# tc

TC is a project made for a college course. It is a small task management system, with the ability to create tasks as standalone tasks, tasks organized by specific projects, or tasks organized by groups of users. User groups also have the ability to create their own projects. Tasks have deadlines and can be completed.

Warning: Code base is very out of date and lacking tests and could use some refactoring. You might need to run `gem install eventmachine -v '1.0.3' -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include` to install all the gems locally.
